#+TITLE: NATS Kit Component

*** Goals

- Should allow safe registering lazily and connect

- Allow middleware that can be used to replace encoders/decoders
  on subs and hooks 

- Should have best practices from NATS implemented

- Should allow for more patterns
  # 
  # scatter/gather, collect call for example
  # 

- Should look into being able to have a logger
  # 
  # like tokio-trace
  # 

- Should have its own inbox for discovery of the component

  # Create middleware with filters
- Filters? Might be more correct? Closer to 

- Services should support distributed cancellation
